            <h2>The Beginning of Apple</h2>
            <p>Apple was founded in 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The three men had a vision to build computers small enough for people to have them in their homes and at work. In 1976 the first computer by Apple, the Apple 1 was created by hand. A year later, the Apple 2 was launched and was a much better upgrade. In 1980, Apple released the Apple 3, the computer suffered a handful of problems and caused a lot of losses. </p>

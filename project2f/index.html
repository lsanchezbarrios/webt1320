            <h2>Apple Over The Years</h2>
            <p>Over the years, Apple has been and remains one of the most successful companies in the world. Since the beginning Apple has been bringing in big, chart topping numbers. In 2018, Apple made history by becoming the first U.S. company to be valued at $1 trillion. In 2020, Apple made history once again by becoming the first U.S. company to reach a $2 trillion market cap. Apple sales have only been going up over the years and don't seem to be slowing down anytime soon.</p>

            <p>Apple's technology has only gotten better over the years. With the company releasing new technology every year, sales only go higher and higher. In 2021 Apple's total sales amounted to 365.82 billion U.S. dollars. Apple has many competitors, and when its competitors release a new piece of technology, Apple releases something even ten times better.
